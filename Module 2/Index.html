                    His most famous works are The Book of Healing, a philosophical and scientific encyclopedia, and The Canon of Medicine, a medical encyclopedia. 
                    which became a standard medical text at many medieval universities and remained in use as late as 1650 In 1973, Avicenna's Canon Of Medicine was reprinted in New York.
                    Besides philosophy and medicine, Avicenna's corpus includes writings on astronomy, alchemy, geography and geology, psychology, Islamic theology, logic, mathematics, physics and works of poetry.

                <h2>Ibn Al-Haytham</h2>
                <p>
                    Ḥasan Ibn al-Haytham (Latinized as Alhazen full name Ibn Al-Hasan Ibn Al-Haytham c. 965 – c. 1040) was an Arab mathematician, astronomer, and physicist of the Islamic Golden Age.
                    Sometimes called "the father of modern optics" he made significant contributions to the principles of optics and visual perception in particular, his most influential work being his Kitāb AL-Manazer ("Book of Optics"), written during 1011–1021, which survived in the Latin edition A polymath, he also wrote on philosophy, theology and medicine.
                    Ibn al-Haytham was the first to explain that vision occurs when light reflects from an object and then passes to one's eyes. And he was the first to point out that vision occurs in the brain, rather than in the eyes. He was also an early proponent of the concept that a hypothesis must be proved by experiments based on confirmable procedures or mathematical evidence—hence understanding the scientific method five centuries before Renaissance scientists.
                    Born in Basra, he spent most of his productive period in the Fatimid capital of Cairo and earned his living authoring various treatises and tutoring members of the nobilities.Ibn Al-Haytham is sometimes given the byname AL-Basri after his birthplace, or al-Misri ("of Egypt") Ibn al-Haytham was nicknamed the "Second Ptolemy" by Abu l-Hasan Bayhaqi , and the "The Physicist" by John Peckham. Ibn Al-Haytham paved the way for the modern science of physical optics.

                <h2>Al-Kindi</h2>
                <p>
                    Abu Yosuf Yaqub Ibn Ishaq As-sabah Al-Kindī (Latin: Alkindus; c. 801–873 AD) was an Arab Muslim philosopher, polymath, mathematician, physician and musician. Al-Kindi was the first of the Muslim peripatetic philosophers, and is unanimously hailed as the "father of Arab philosophy for his synthesis, adaptation and promotion of Greek and Hellenistic philosophy in the Muslim world.
                    In the field of mathematics, al-Kindi played an important role in introducing Indian numerals to the Islamic and Christian world. Al-Kindi was also one of the fathers of cryptography. His book entitled Manuscript on Deciphering Cryptographic Messages gave rise to the birth of cryptanalysis, was the earliest known use of statistical inference, and introduced several new methods of breaking ciphers. Using his mathematical and medical expertise, he was able to develop a scale that would allow doctors to quantify the potency of their medication.
